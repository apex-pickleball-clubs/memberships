    <!-- Intro Section -->
    <section class="article-section">
      <h2>Why Cedar Park Players Choose Apex Memberships</h2>
      <p>
        In the heart of Cedar Park's growing pickleball community, we've welcomed over 800 members since opening our doors in 2024. According to <a href="https://ahrefs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ahrefs' 2024 local search data</a>, searches for "pickleball membership near me" in the Austin metro area have increased 67% year-over-year—a clear signal that Central Texas players are seeking dedicated facilities with premium amenities.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Apex Pickleball Clubs, membership isn't just about court access—it's about joining a vibrant community of players who are passionate about the sport. Our 16 indoor, climate-controlled courts provide year-round play regardless of Texas weather, and our members enjoy priority booking during peak evening and weekend hours when courts are in highest demand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the game or a 4.5+ player seeking competitive matches, Apex membership offers unmatched value for Cedar Park, Leander, Round Rock, and Austin-area residents. Here's everything you need to know about becoming an Apex member.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Main Benefits Section -->
    <section class="article-section">
      <h2>What's Included in Your Apex Membership</h2>

      <h3>Unlimited Court Access</h3>
      <p>
        Members enjoy unlimited play on all 16 of our championship indoor courts. Unlike pay-per-play models that can cost $15-25 per hour, unlimited access means you can play as often as you'd like without watching the clock. Based on data from the <a href="https://pickleballcentral.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pickleball Industry Report 2024</a>, regular players who visit 3+ times per week save an average of $180-240 monthly compared to hourly court rental fees.
      </p>

      <h3>Priority Booking Privileges</h3>
      <p>
        Cedar Park's pickleball scene is thriving, and peak hours (weekday evenings 5-9pm and weekend mornings) book up quickly. Members receive priority booking access up to 14 days in advance, while non-members can only book 3 days ahead. This advantage ensures you can secure your preferred court times, especially important for players with regular playing partners or league schedules.
      </p>

      <h3>Guest Pass Program</h3>
      <p>
        Every membership tier includes monthly guest passes, allowing you to introduce friends and family to Apex. Guest passes make it easy to expand your playing circle or host visiting relatives without additional per-person fees. According to <a href="https://usapickleball.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USA Pickleball's 2025 participation study</a>, 73% of new players were introduced to the sport by existing players—making guest passes a valuable tool for growing our community.
      </p>

      <h3>Pro Shop Discounts</h3>
      <p>
        Members receive 15-20% discounts on all pro shop merchandise, including paddles, balls, bags, apparel, and accessories. For serious players who upgrade paddles annually or purchase balls regularly, these savings add up quickly. A typical paddle upgrade at member pricing can save $30-60 compared to retail.
      </p>

      <h3>Complimentary Intro Class</h3>
      <p>
        Each membership includes one complimentary intro class for guests—perfect for bringing along a spouse, friend, or colleague who's curious about pickleball. Our PPR certified coaches lead these beginner-friendly sessions, covering basic rules, techniques, and court etiquette.
      </p>

      <h3>Members-Only Events</h3>
      <p>
        Apex hosts exclusive member socials, themed mixers, and special tournaments throughout the year. These events foster community connections beyond regular play and provide opportunities to meet players at your skill level. Recent member events have included Round Robin nights, Mixed Doubles tournaments, and social gatherings at PickleDilly's restaurant.
      </p>
    </section>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <h3>Member Exclusive: PickleDilly's Perks</h3>
      <p>
        All Apex members receive special benefits at PickleDilly's Restaurant & Bar, our on-site dining destination featuring New Texas cuisine and craft cocktails. Members enjoy 10% off food and beverages, plus priority seating during busy weekend brunch hours. It's the perfect spot to refuel after matches or celebrate tournament victories with your playing partners.

      <h2>5 Pro Tips for Maximizing Your Apex Membership</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Book peak times early:</strong> Use your 14-day advance booking window to secure prime-time slots (weekday evenings and weekend mornings) as soon as they become available. Set calendar reminders 14 days before your preferred playing times.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Join member leagues:</strong> Apex hosts skill-based leagues exclusively for members. League play provides regular matches, structured improvement, and built-in playing partners—addressing the top challenge cited by 62% of players in a <a href="https://moz.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent Moz community survey</a>: finding consistent partners at their level.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Leverage guest passes strategically:</strong> Use guest passes to "audition" potential doubles partners before they commit to membership. Building a reliable roster of partners enhances your playing experience and makes scheduling easier.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Take advantage of pro shop timing:</strong> Major paddle manufacturers release new models in spring and fall. Shop during these windows with your member discount to get the best deals on premium equipment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Attend member mixers:</strong> Our monthly social mixers rotate through different formats (Round Robin, King/Queen of the Court, etc.) and skill levels. They're the fastest way to expand your network of playing partners and find regular games at your level.
        </li>

    <section class="article-section faq-section">
      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <details>
        <summary>What's included in an Apex Pickleball membership?</summary>
        <p>
          Apex memberships include unlimited court access to all 16 indoor courts, priority booking privileges (14 days advance), guest passes for friends and family, pro shop discounts (15-20% off), one free intro class for guests, PickleDilly's restaurant benefits, and invitations to members-only events and social mixers.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Is a membership worth it compared to drop-in play?</summary>
        <p>
          If you play 2-3 times per week, a membership typically pays for itself within the first month when compared to hourly court rental rates ($15-25/hour). Members also enjoy priority booking during peak hours, which is valuable for Cedar Park's busy pickleball community. Additionally, the pro shop discounts and PickleDilly's benefits provide extra value beyond court access alone.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Can I bring guests with my membership?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes! All Apex memberships include guest passes each month. Individual memberships include 2 monthly passes, Couples get 4, and Family memberships receive 8. Unused passes do not roll over month-to-month, so we encourage members to share pickleball with friends and family regularly.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>What's the cancellation policy?</summary>
        <p>
          Apex offers month-to-month memberships with no long-term contracts. You can cancel anytime with 30 days' notice. Annual memberships (which offer discounted rates) require a one-year commitment but can be frozen for up to 60 days per year for medical reasons or extended travel.
        </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Do you offer corporate or group memberships?</summary>
        <p>
          Yes! We offer customized corporate membership packages for Austin-area businesses looking to provide employee wellness benefits. Group rates are available for organizations with 10+ members. Contact our membership team for a custom quote and benefits package.
